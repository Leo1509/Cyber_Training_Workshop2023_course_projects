CyberTraining Workshop 2023

As demanded, the files are organized in two folders:

project - It contains the .pdf with my project manuscript (a straightforward application of the Libra/CP2K worflow),
along with different figures ans Jupyter notebooks files.

course - it contains the QUANTICS, NWChem and GAMESS exercises I conducted. I did not introduce Libra files here since
they are already in the project folder. Regarding GAMESS: the inputs and outputs are 'overwritten' with titania geometries
and results, since I tried to run the workflows we learned in the workshop using my titania systems and connect that resuts
with my project. Unfortunately, I was not successful.
