# CyberTraining Workshop 2023

## Joseph Kelly

My project worked towards implementing the mapping approach to surface hopping method (MASH) in Libra.

Guide to directory:

* project
  1. MASH\_implementation.pdf
     The written component desribing MASH, how I implemented it and some early results
     
  2. libra\_code
     Files I changed from the original Libra package to implement MASH
     
  3. python\_code
     Files for running MASH using my own indpendent code


* course 
  1. A zip folder containing folders containing results from in class activities invovling Libra, NWChem, Quantics and Tensor Trains. I struggled more with getting GAMESS to run successfully and appreciated seeing Prof. Filatov walk through examples so I still could appreciate what it can do. 
    
  2. The image processing example using tensor trains has been omitted because of the large size of the image files used. I successfully compressed one of my wedding photos and even managed to get decent behavior for my wife's white dress (7.4 MB to 4.1 MB). The most agressive method mostly washed out the image in noise but the general shapes of people were still visible and required 2.9 MB of memory.
