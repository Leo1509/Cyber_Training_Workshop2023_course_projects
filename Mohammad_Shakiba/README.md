## 1. NWChem interface with Libra code

In `1_nwchem_libra`, I have provided the file `overlap.py` which contains the script for computing the MO overlap using Libra built-in functions. 
It uses the `molden` file format which is generated by NWChem for C6H6 molecule using B3LYP functional from Libxc library. 

NWChem input:
```

## 2. Generalizing the Libra/CP2K interface to K-points calculations

In `2_cp2k_libra_kpoints`, I have provided the necessary files for computing the overlap between K-states for each K-point. 
In the jupyter notebook file, `kpoints_cp2k.ipynb`, I show how one can compute the overlap between 
two different K-states of similar or different K-points.  Detailed explanation is given in the Jupyter notebook file.


## 3. Exact quantum dynamics calculations for Tully model problems using Quantics

In `3_quantics_exact_dynamics`, I have provided the input and operator files for exact quantum dynamics calculations using Quantics. 
The population and energy dynamics produced by Quantics, using MCTDH method, are plotted in `Quantics_data_analysis.ipynb` notebook.

Quantics operator filei, `model_2.op`, hamiltonian section:

```
